Thanks for giving me the opportunity to come learn.

I definatly had some trials during the coarse but enjoyed learning how to create new things.

My website will only be the home page. with placeholder images. reponsive nav and there is column place holder on the left in desktop view. This homepage will be conistent with the rest of the pages and architecture of the site.  Feel freee to email me if you have any questions.
